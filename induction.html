								<p>The induction module for university students focuses on familiarizing them with the university's online platform and providing guidance on how to 
										submit tasks effectively. It aims to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to navigate the digital tools and resources 
										available to them throughout their academic journey. The module begins with an orientation session, where students are introduced to the 
										university's online platform and its features. They learn how to access their course materials, syllabi, and other relevant resources. 
										The session also covers the different communication channels available, such as discussion forums and messaging systems, enabling students 
										to interact with their peers and instructors. Following the orientation, the module incorporates interactive tutorials and hands-on 
										activities to provide practical training on using the online platform. Students learn how to navigate the interface, upload and download 
										course materials, participate in online discussions, and submit assignments or projects electronically. 
										The module may also include guidance on formatting requirements, file naming conventions, and submission deadlines to ensure that students 
										understand and adhere to the established procedures. To reinforce the learning, the induction module may incorporate assessments or quizzes 
										that allow students to practice using the online platform and assess their understanding of the submission process. Additionally, it may 
										provide access to supplementary resources, such as video tutorials or user guides, for students to refer to as they become more proficient 
										in using the platform. Overall, the induction module aims to empower university students by providing them with the necessary skills and 
										knowledge to navigate the university's online platform confidently. By mastering the platform's functionalities and submission procedures, 
										students can effectively engage with their coursework and enhance their overall learning experience.</p>
