								<h2>Introduction to<br />
								Cyber Security</h2>
								<p>
									The "Introduction to Cyber Security" module offers an 
									overview of cybersecurity, covering fundamental concepts, threats, 
									and protective techniques. Participants are taught about the evolution 
									of cybersecurity, various cyber threats, and the significance of 
									securing information and networks. The module covers principles of 
									secure computing, common vulnerabilities, security policies, and 
									incident response plans. It also addresses emerging trends like IoT 
									security and cloud security. Practical exercises and demonstrations 
									reinforce the learning, enabling participants to make informed 
									decisions and contribute to a safer digital environment.

										Collaborative discussions require students to share their thoughts
									    on a specific topic. Intitial posts would be posted by students
										with their initial thoughts on the subject. Other students in 
										the course have an oppurtunity to respond and share some insight into
										the subject from the persepctive of the initial post. Students then have
										an oppurtunity to respond to these insights and update their initial posts.

										<b>Why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security.</b>
										“Cyber Security plays an important role in the field of information technology. 
										Securing the information have become one of the biggest challenges in the present day.” (REDDY & REDDY, 2014). 
										With technology becoming more critical for everyday life globally, cyber security has 
										become a global issue. There is a constant race to protect devices from cyber threats 
										by creating new and improved security measures and protocols to protect them. 
										Many companies across the globe must invest into their cyber security to safeguard 
										their devices and their data. For example, Samsung is a South Korean company and is one of 
										the largest producers of electronic devices such as cellphones, televisions and much more. (Bondarenko, 2023)
										With a net worth of 262 billion dollars, should the company face a cyber-attack, the 
										damages would cost Samsung a lot of their net worth. It is therefore worthwhile for this 
										technology company to invest into their cyber security to protect their data as well as 
										their customer’s data as well. Should their customer’s data be leaked through this attack, 
										the trust in the brand from the general consumer would decrease significantly damaging the 
										company’s reputation. This is something any global company should avoid to not lose their customer 
										base. To conclude, cyber security has become a global issue. Therefore, companies must the 
										investment into cyber security to protect their data and users from cyber threats.
										

										Initial Post - Summary
										by Quan Venter - Monday, 22 May 2023, 1:11 PM
										<b>Why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security.</b>
										Considering what has been shared amongst peers, lectures and all the content on the virtual learning environment, it can be concluded that there is a need for the investment of cyber security in companies. Especially in the bigger companies such as Samsung and similar businesses.
										It is clear that there has been attacks on the bigger companies of the world who are quite well known. It seems that hackers and malicious users will target the bigger considering the amount of damage and information can be obtained. In March of 2022, Microsoft suffered from a cyber-attack that was meant to compromise their products such as Cortana, Bing and several other products. Microsoft responded swiftly and the hacking attempt was stopped in two days. Microsoft received massive praise for their swift response to the hack. (Sveinsson, 2022)
										To reference the initial post, Samsung also suffered from a data breach in July of 2022 with a claimed 200GB of data being compromised. Samsung claimed however, the data breach they suffered was dealt with and customers have nothing to worry about. (Orr, 2022)
										It is clear that hackers wish to target bigger companies due to the lack of wealth the companies hold in terms of data. Danny Palmer, a senior writer for zdnet.com, wrote the following statement in an article about hackers targeting the bigger corporations. “Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in small and medium-sized businesses in the defence industry are leaving the companies – and larger organisations further up the supply chain – vulnerable to cyberattacks.” (Palmer, 2021). Even though Palmer referenced companies in the defense industry, this stretches further into other company sectors such as the technological sector.
										How can companies prevent cyber-attacks? With technology ever evolving, it is impossible to keep up with the latest technological trends and the security that goes with the latest trends. The most effective way to minimize the risk of cyber-attacks for any individual or business would be to educate the human factor. By providing strict policies for staff and educating individuals on cyber threats would start to show a decrease of successful attacks such as phishing attacks.
 										To conclude, cyber security should be invested by companies. This will decrease the number of successful cyber-attacks hopefully leading to a decrease of attempted cyber-attacks.
