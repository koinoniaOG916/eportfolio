										<b>Why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security.</b>
										“Cyber Security plays an important role in the field of information technology. 
										Securing the information have become one of the biggest challenges in the present day.” (REDDY & REDDY, 2014). 
										With technology becoming more critical for everyday life globally, cyber security has 
										become a global issue. There is a constant race to protect devices from cyber threats 
										by creating new and improved security measures and protocols to protect them. 
										Many companies across the globe must invest into their cyber security to safeguard 
										their devices and their data. For example, Samsung is a South Korean company and is one of 
										the largest producers of electronic devices such as cellphones, televisions and much more. (Bondarenko, 2023)
										With a net worth of 262 billion dollars, should the company face a cyber-attack, the 
										damages would cost Samsung a lot of their net worth. It is therefore worthwhile for this 
										technology company to invest into their cyber security to protect their data as well as 
										their customer’s data as well. Should their customer’s data be leaked through this attack, 
										the trust in the brand from the general consumer would decrease significantly damaging the 
										company’s reputation. This is something any global company should avoid to not lose their customer 
										base. To conclude, cyber security has become a global issue. Therefore, companies must the 
										investment into cyber security to protect their data and users from cyber threats.

										<b>Why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security.</b>
										Considering what has been shared amongst peers, lectures and all the content on the virtual learning environment, it can be concluded that there is a need for the investment of cyber security in companies. Especially in the bigger companies such as Samsung and similar businesses.
										It is clear that there has been attacks on the bigger companies of the world who are quite well known. It seems that hackers and malicious users will target the bigger considering the amount of damage and information can be obtained. In March of 2022, Microsoft suffered from a cyber-attack that was meant to compromise their products such as Cortana, Bing and several other products. Microsoft responded swiftly and the hacking attempt was stopped in two days. Microsoft received massive praise for their swift response to the hack. (Sveinsson, 2022)
										To reference the initial post, Samsung also suffered from a data breach in July of 2022 with a claimed 200GB of data being compromised. Samsung claimed however, the data breach they suffered was dealt with and customers have nothing to worry about. (Orr, 2022)
										It is clear that hackers wish to target bigger companies due to the lack of wealth the companies hold in terms of data. Danny Palmer, a senior writer for zdnet.com, wrote the following statement in an article about hackers targeting the bigger corporations. “Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in small and medium-sized businesses in the defence industry are leaving the companies – and larger organisations further up the supply chain – vulnerable to cyberattacks.” (Palmer, 2021). Even though Palmer referenced companies in the defense industry, this stretches further into other company sectors such as the technological sector.
										How can companies prevent cyber-attacks? With technology ever evolving, it is impossible to keep up with the latest technological trends and the security that goes with the latest trends. The most effective way to minimize the risk of cyber-attacks for any individual or business would be to educate the human factor. By providing strict policies for staff and educating individuals on cyber threats would start to show a decrease of successful attacks such as phishing attacks.
 										To conclude, cyber security should be invested by companies. This will decrease the number of successful cyber-attacks hopefully leading to a decrease of attempted cyber-attacks.

										<b>Security Technologies and their Context in which they can be Employed.</b>
										The field of cyber security constantly sees the evolution of security technologies to counter the new security threats that emerge. This evolution is a critical part of cyber security because without the new security technologies, we have no defense against the new and upcoming threats. Two security technologies which has shown this type of evolution would be that of Anti-Virus programs and Virtual Private Networks (VPN’s).
“The purpose of antivirus (AV) software is to detect, neutralize or eradicate malware (malicious software).” (Siciliano, 2014).
 Anti-Viruses (AV) are a prime example of security technology that evolves with new threats that arise. AVs work by scanning incoming files and files already stored on your system and compares them to a library of known cyber threats to alert the user to potential threats. (Vigderman, 2023). Anti-Virus programs also can remove files that could cause threats to your device. Some Anti-Viruses such as Bitdefender will even scan your emails to look for links that could cause damage to your device and will alert you before you even open the email. The one downside to Anti-Virus programs is that most of them require you to have a paid subscription to make use of all their features that assist you in getting viruses off your computer or to have automatic scanning of your computer. Another downside is that AVs are not always perfect. A cyber threat such as a Polymorphic Malware can easily go undetected as most Anti-Virus programs rely on signature-based detection. Polymorphic Malware will regenerate its signature when it is detected making it virtually impossible for Anti-Viruses to fight against it. (Melnyk, 2022). Anti-Virus programs are a great way to provide basic safeguarding for computers in homes and businesses eliminating majority of potential cyber threats that can be faced.
“A VPN creates a secure connection between your devices and the internet.” (Janssen, 2023)
VPNs are very useful for hiding your network traffic from unwanted visitors. Most VPN’s have their own servers through which all your network traffic is routed and shields your real IP address with another IP address. How secure your VPN is will depend on which VPN you connect to and which server from that specific VPN provider you connect to. These servers themselves must also contain safeguards from outside threats or else a malicious user would easily be able to decrypt your connection and find your real location and access your internet history. VPN service providers also design their VPNs towards specific use cases as well while providing the basic features that all VPNs do. Some will optimize their VPNs to allow users to stream content that they couldn’t access before while others optimize their services for security to protect a user’s internet activity more securely. It is also important to remember to get the most out of your VPN provider, a paid subscription may be required. (How does a VPN work? advantages of using a VPN 2023). VPNs are a great way for home users to give themselves that extra layer of protection that an Anti-Virus cannot provide while in the business environment, VPNs provide a safeguard for users to hide their network traffic that could contain sensitive data that cannot be leaked.
Both software solutions highlighted above are valuable assets to any home or business setup. The important factor to remember is cyber threats constantly evolve, so must the security that protects us from the threats. They will never be able to cover all known threats but will provide a foundation covering many threats allowing users in homes and businesses to continue their daily routine feeling a little bit safer.

										<b>Security Technologies and their Context in which they can be Employed.</b>
										The security technologies highlighted in the initial post was that of Anti-Virus software and Virtual Private Networks, otherwise known as VPN’s. Considering the contributions to the forum and interacting with other forums, the importance of security technologies can clearly be seen. However, there is a lot more that must be considered when setting up security technologies to mitigate cyber threats as each security technology is not without its weaknesses.

Anti-Virus software is a great place to start incorporating safeguards against cyber security threats. AV companies such as Bitdefender or Kaspersky has come a long way in terms of their features that they offer to clients including ransomware protection, spam link detection and web browsing protection. Even though modern AV’s cover a vast number of cyber threats, they are by no means perfect. (Melnyk, 2022)
Considering peer responses given to the initial post, user error is a risk for Anti-Virus software as well. Many users will not opt to make use of the premium Anti-Virus software which does not provide the same amount of protection and users will also choose to not allow automatic updates. This stops the AV software from updating their databases and libraries of cyber threats. Automatic updates are a must for AVs to assist with keeping devices safe and secure.
VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks, are also a great way to secure your online traffic. They are not without their weaknesses. VPNs need to be coupled with a firewall to ensure that your traffic is indeed protected. A firewall would protect the user from going to websites that are either fake or dangerous while a VPN changes your IP address and routes your network traffic through different servers. (Relationship between VPN and Firewall 2022).
One can also use double VPN providers to further hide your activities online from prying eyes. VPNs are mostly secure but if a malicious user gets hold of the encryption key, then the VPN server can be broken into, and the connection will no longer be secure. (What is a VPN tunnel and how does it work? | Cybernews 2023)
Although this is an unlikely scenario to take place, it is a weakness of VPNs none the less. Another significant weakness is that of user error. Should the user wish to have private network traffic but fails to set the VPN to turn on automatically, then the user will not be protected unless they physically turn on the VPN themselves.

To conclude, the security technologies highlighted above are worthwhile to have installed on any machine. They are not without their weaknesses but by combining various technologies together, users can mitigate most cyber threats. User error, however, can be a crippling factor for any of these technologies. Ensuring that they are properly setup will protect the user from almost all malicious cyber threats. It is critical that users understand their security technologies installed to ensure that they do not change settings that they should not change.
