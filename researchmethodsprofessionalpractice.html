								<p>Unit 7 required the students to select a topic from a list provided by the University of Essex for the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. A literature review then needed to be conducted of the selected topic where students read various journals and articles around the topic to assess the topic and to summarize the current knowledge that is available to the public around the topic. This assignment was given to the students to prepare them for the research proposal that would need to be drafted and presented as the next submission piece for the module. 

<br>This assignment is available for viewing on the GitHub repository. </br>

This topic could not be the same as the one selected for Unit 7 unless an element from the topic to have changed. For example, if the United Kingdom was the country of interest in Unit 7, and South Africa was chosen as the country of interest in Unit 10, then this would be acceptable. This assignment required the students to produce a research proposal including selecting research methodologies and designs to aid in the research around the topic chosen. Students had to submit a 15-minute recorded presentation on power point. The recording, power point and transcript were all submitted for marks.</span></p>

								<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Unit 12 requested the students to write a reflective essay asking for each individual student to elaborate on their understanding of the module and share any experiences that they may have of the module. Some of the questions that the students needed to ask was:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>What did I learn?</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>What was my experience on working alone for the module?</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>What impact did this module have on my personal development?</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>What impact did this module have on my professional development?</span></li>
</ul>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Another aspect of this submission is the E-Portfolio component of the module allowing students to showcase their work for the module in a format that is readable and understanding for those who have not done similar work on the module before. The Eportfolio was instructed to be hosted on Github with the aspects of the module available for download on the GitHub.</span></p>

								<h3>Evaluation of the Research Methods and Professional Practice Module (Unit 7 and Unit 10)</h3>
								
								<p>
								<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
							<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong><u><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Evaluation of Unit 7 and Unit 10</span></u></strong></p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Both submissions required the student to conduct literature reviews of a topic offered by the University of Essex with Unit 10 requiring a more in-depth approach asking for a research proposal for the topic choice. The topic chosen was</span> <strong><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Ransomware Attacks and its effects on a selected country or sector</span></strong><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>. For unit 7, the United Kingdom was selected as the country of interest for the literature review. In Unit 10, the country was changed to South Africa, my home country, where a research proposal was designed and made for the literature review and then presented via a power point and recording</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Unit 7&rsquo;s literature review proved to be a straight forward task that required research to be conducted. This included reading various articles and journals around the topic including previous attacks and knowledge that is readily available. This assessment was used to teach the students the importance of writing a proper literature review and the research behind the review needs to be conducted properly. The format in which a review is structured is also critical. This assignment also aided in teaching the correct format to students ensuring the review is readable to future readers and potentially can be used in future literature reviews as a source of information.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Unit 10 widened the requirements from the student. A research proposal had to be developed around the chosen topic. The structure of the research proposal was far greater than the literature review which includes:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>A project title: A short and brief explanation around the topic of choice.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Significance of the topic: Under this section, the student must provide why the project is so significant and how the research can help others in the future.</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Objectives: An explanation around the objective of the research proposal had to be provided. These were the end goals of the proposal outlining what are the objectives of the proposal and how it should be used in the future.</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Key Literature: This in itself is a mini literature review of sorts. As in the name, this section highlights the specific articles and journals that encouraged the idea to research the topic and will aid in steering the research proposal to where it needs to go.</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Ethical Considerations: When dealing with such topics, it is important to take into account that the research proposal could cause damage to companies referenced in the articles as well as entice malicious users to entertain the idea of considering crimes in the area of study. The research proposal must be outlined in such a way to try and avoid any kind of conflict.</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Timeline: The timeline of the research proposal had to be outlined, establishing how long it would take to complete the proposal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>After establishing this structure, a presentation showcasing the research proposal was recorded and the transcript written for the recording.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-family:Calibri;'>Overall, the module has shown students the importance or conducting research properly and outlining a research proposal properly as well. Although some would consider this to be a fundamental skill in tertiary education, I personally believe the skill should only be conducted in depth if you are pursuing an area that would require it. With this point being made, Cyber Security is definitely a field that benefits using proper research methodologies and literature reviews. Considering the thesis that is coming up for students studying their masters, these skills that come from this module will greatly assist them to finish their thesis well.&nbsp;</span></p>
