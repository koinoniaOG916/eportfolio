						<h2>Security and Risk Management</h2>
						<p>With security and risk becoming an increasing factor in todays IT enviroment, it is critical to have a good understanding of the risks that do exist, calculating those risks and implementing strategies to mitigate those risks
						and implement the correct strategies in order for a user or business to continue their journey. 
						Below you will find a summary of the asessments carried out during the module and buttons to the github branch to view them. At the end of this page is a comparison between assignments from Unit 6 and Unit 11 
						which followed on from each other.</p>

								<p>In unit 6 of the Security and Risk Management module, we were split into groups with our peers and had to work together to 
								   produce a Risk Identification Report for a scenario based around the fabricated pet company known as Pampered Pets who wanted to 
							           start the digitalization process.  Our group had three members and the assignment had three main questions that needed to be answered. 
								   As a team, after our team contract was signed and agreed upon, we decided to split the work into each person researching and answering one 
								   of the main questions of the assignment, once this was done, we would reconvene and work together to merge our content together 
								   and develop an introduction and conclusion as well. This worked well as each of us had contributed in a meaningful way and could assist the 
							           other group members in accomplishing the goal of creating and submitting the final risk identification report. 
								   Four team meetings were held for this assignment. The videos are available in the GitHub repository and transcriptions for 
								   the meetings were generated by the Fireflies AI platform.
									<br />
									<br />
								   Available on the GitHub Repository is:
								<br />•	The individual contribution to research
								<br />•	The final assignment with merged research
								<br />•	Recorded Team Meetings
								<br />•	The transcripts of the Team Meetings generated by Fireflies AI.

								<p>
							        In unit 11, the scenario provided to us in Unit 6 was updated where the digitalization process had commenced. 
								The scenario indicated that the business had now acquired an internation supply chain and international warehousing. 
								It was also indicated that the business had received two high profile clients who were both concerned about the companies 
								products degrading with the international supply chain. We were requested to create an executive summary to investigate, 
								calculate and mitigate any potentials risks that could arise from this decision as well as come up with a disaster recovery plan 
							        that the business Pampered Pets could use if a disaster had to take place.
									<br />
									<br />
								This was an individual assignment and required research and calculations to complete. The completed assessment can be found in the GitHub.

								<p>
								Unit 12 requested a reflective piece on the module from each individual student to share their experience and understanding on the module. The questions the students needed to ask included: 
								<br />•	What did I learn?
								<br />•	What were my contributions to the projects?
								<br />•	What was my experience working in a team?
								<br />•	What impact did it have on my personal development?
								<br />•	What impact did it have on my professional development?
									<br />
									<br />
								Also, forming part of Unit 12’s submission, was a formal submission to the E-Portfolio on GitHub where each student submits their work as a showcase for lecturers, 
								tutors, and any other interested user the work done for this module. 
								This included an evaluation of the project that was done in Unit 6 and Unit 11.
									<br />
									<br />
								Unit 12’s full submission can be found in the GitHub which includes:
								<br />•	The hardcopy of all the texts for the E-Portfolio submission.
								<br />•	Evaluation of the Module Project business - Pampered Pets
								<br />•	Reflective Essay

								<h3>Evaluation of the Pampered Pets project (Unit 6 and Unit 11)</h3>
								
								<p>
								<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
							<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Evaluation of the Pampered Pets project (Unit 6 and Unit 11)</strong></span></p>
<p>Both submissions found in Unit 6 and Unit 11 revolved around a company known as Pampered Pets. Based on the scenario, Pampered Pets approached the students firstly as a group and asked for a Risk Identification Report for them to assess the risks they could face while undergoing the digitalization process and afterwards providing an executive summary based on an update in the scenario provided in the later unit.</p>
<p>Unit 6&rsquo;s assessment was the Risk Identification Report. As a group, the workload for the report was split among everyone and each contributed their own individual work. Once everyone provided their own research the individual pieces were merged and made into one cohesive Risk Identification Report. This assessment taught us to understand potential risks and to try and analyze each part of the business closely to try and identify any risks, big or small, and with each risk identified, to find a solution to the risk.</p>
<p>Once the Risk Identification Report was complete, the scenario was updated in Unit 11 to indicate that Pampered Pets started the digitalization process and acquired an international supply chain and warehousing. It was also indicated that Pampered Pets acquired two high profile clients and that the clients requested a risk calculation on the acquisitions during the digitalization process and a disaster recovery plan to be implemented. This was requested in the format of an Executive Summary to be done as individuals. This part of the project proved to be much more challenging due to the workload that was substantially more than the Risk Identification Report in Unit 6. The assessment in Unit 11 should have also been done as a team to truly continue from Unit 6. It was also evident while completing the Unit 11 assessment that the data required to complete the risk calculations had to be purchased from companies that previously conducted such risk calculations. The data that was freely accessible in the end proved to be inferior for exact calculations as requested by the assessment in Unit 11.</p>
<p>Overall, the Pampered Pets project was a good scenario that allowed team work as well as individual work. However, it would have been better if the projects were either individual work or teamwork. Should the project require teamwork, it would have been better for the teamwork to happen after the individual work as this would have allowed the project to be easier on the students as well as encouraging cohesive teamwork among peers. It would have also benefited the students if the choice of data was more freely accessible so that students could perform the requested calculations more precisely.</p>
