								<p>In unit 6 of the Security and Risk Management module, we were split into groups with our peers and had to work together to 
								   produce a Risk Identification Report for a scenario based around the fabricated pet company known as Pampered Pets who wanted to 
							           start the digitalization process.  Our group had three members and the assignment had three main questions that needed to be answered. 
								   As a team, after our team contract was signed and agreed upon, we decided to split the work into each person researching and answering one 
								   of the main questions of the assignment, once this was done, we would reconvene and work together to merge our content together 
								   and develop an introduction and conclusion as well. This worked well as each of us had contributed in a meaningful way and could assist the 
							           other group members in accomplishing the goal of creating and submitting the final risk identification report. 
								   Four team meetings were held for this assignment. The videos are available in the GitHub repository and transcriptions for 
								   the meetings were generated by the Fireflies AI platform.
								   Available on the GitHub Repository is:
								<br />•	The individual contribution to research
								<br />•	The final assignment with merged research
								<br />•	Recorded Team Meetings
								<br />•	The transcripts of the Team Meetings generated by Fireflies AI.

								<p>
							        In unit 11, the scenario provided to us in Unit 6 was updated where the digitalization process had commenced. 
								The scenario indicated that the business had now acquired an internation supply chain and international warehousing. 
								It was also indicated that the business had received two high profile clients who were both concerned about the companies 
								products degrading with the international supply chain. We were requested to create an executive summary to investigate, 
								calculate and mitigate any potentials risks that could arise from this decision as well as come up with a disaster recovery plan 
							        that the business Pampered Pets could use if a disaster had to take place.
								This was an individual assignment and required research and calculations to complete. The completed assessment can be found in the GitHub.
