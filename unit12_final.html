<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reflective Essay:</strong></span><br />The Security and Risk Management module offered by the University of Essex Online was used to teach students the importance of understanding the risks that businesses face in the digital workspace and the importance of following security guidelines put in place as well as making sure that the proper procedures, such as disaster recovery solutions, are in place so that a business can operate during majority of situations that could be faced, big or small. <br />With the assistance of the assessments in this module based on the scenario with the fabricated business Pampered Pets who wanted to undergo the digitalization process and eventually acquired an international supply chain with international warehousing, and two very big clients, students would have been able to apply the various skills that they learnt throughout the module to complete documentation which included a risk identification reports, disaster recovery plans, calculating risks based on various statistics and mitigations for the calculated risks. <br />What did I learn from this module?<br />With the world of Information Technology being ever evolving, the importance of risk calculations became clearer as it can be applied to any business. Understanding the risks that each action has on a business is critical towards a business&rsquo;s success and having mitigations for those risks is also critical to ensure that the business remains operational. The importance of a disaster recovery plan also came to light showing how critical it is that a business has a strategy in place to mitigate most types of disasters to remain operational during times of uncertainty. <br />Security and Risk Management is a very theoretical module as well with very little practical aspects. Most calculations are either done based on statistics that already exist or strategies are made based on the possibility of certain disasters happening and the likeliness of the disasters happening. The practical aspect would be the designing and implementation of the strategies and performing risk calculations, however, it is still a field that is very theoretical.<br />Experience in a Development Team:<br />The team that I was assigned to worked cohesively majority of the time. It was beneficial that I worked with one of the team members on another project as we knew how we each contributed and how we liked to work on previous assessments. Most team meetings went well, and most deadlines were met. There were times where a little encouragement was needed for team members to adhere to their deadlines and to stay on topic, majority of the time there was a cohesive atmosphere producing reliable work.<br />Unfortunately, there were some differences that needed to be settled initially and bad feelings carried throughout the course of the project. Once this was all settled, however, teamwork resumed, and an assignment was produced ready to be submitted. <br />The impact the module had in Professional Development:<br />This module shows how critical this area of cyber security is and the role that risk mitigations and disaster plans have in the professional workspace. Having a clear understanding of these areas when working in cyber security will aid anyone in critically thinking about the risks that come with decisions that must be taken to advance a business forward into the digital age.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />The impact the module had in Personal Development:<br />Analyzing and understanding risks is something that can be applied to your personal life as well as professional life. From a personal development perspective, this module teaches an individual to analyze life decisions to make sure you understand the risks involved in that decision. If the risks come to pass, you can implement mitigations to avoid those risks as well. In all aspects of life there are risks that we take. We can either take them blindly or critically analyze them and have mitigation plans in place to avoid the risks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><br />Overall, the security and risk management module taught individuals the importance of understanding risks, having mitigation plans for those risks and implementing procedures should any of the risks come to pass and cause a business to stagger in their development. This mentality can extend beyond business practice and be implemented in a person&rsquo;s personal development as well.</p>
